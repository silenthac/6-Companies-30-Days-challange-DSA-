//In this queastion we have to find the name of those people whose access is more than or equal to three times within one hour period 
//My first approach sort according to the name and  and their access time using sperator custom sort operator and then make a window of each   name and find whether  somewhere there is condition becoming true and then move to another name  or we can say another window

//Second approach
 // to implement above approach in a very readable manner use map of string and vector<string> which store the access time of each people and then directly try to find  out whether this student is making condition true or not.
